Website performance plays a big role in both **SEO** and **user experience**. A faster site means visitors stay longer and search engines rank it higher.  
One simple but powerful technique to speed up your site is using **LQIP (Low Quality Image Placeholders)**.  
This post will guide you through the process of creating and using **Base64 LQIP images** in your **Jekyll Chirpy** theme.

##  What is LQIP?
 ![Desktop View](/assets/img/lqip-demo.png){: width="972" height="589" .w-50 .left}

**LQIP (Low Quality Image Placeholder)** is a small, blurred, lightweight version of your original image.  
It appears instantly when a page loads, and is replaced by the full image once it’s downloaded.  
It helps in improving **perceived performance** and creating a smooth **lazy loading** effect.

## Prepare Your Image

- **Ensure Image Readiness**:
  - For the Chirpy theme, your image should have a resolution of `1200 x 630` pixels.
  - This resolution ensures the images look great and maintain a consistent aspect ratio.

- **Aspect Ratio Requirement**:
  - The aspect ratio should meet `1.91:1`.
  - If the aspect ratio does not meet this requirement, the image will be scaled and cropped.

- **Using Canva for Image Preparation**:
  - [Canva](https://www.canva.com/){:target="_blank"} is an excellent tool for resizing and cropping images effectively.
  - It provides a visual interface for precise control over cropping and composition.
  - Steps to prepare your image in Canva:
    1. Create a new design with custom dimensions of 1200x630 pixels.
    2. Upload your image and place it within the design.
    3. Adjust the image to fit the frame, ensuring important elements are visible.
    4. Export the image as a high-quality PNG or JPG.

##  Steps to Create a Base64 LQIP Image

Here’s the complete process to convert your images into **Base64 LQIP placeholders** for Jekyll Chirpy:

###  Step 1: Compress or Convert Image to WebP

Before creating an LQIP, reduce the file size by converting or compressing your original image.  
You can use any of these free online tools:

- [Cloudinary Tool Hub](https://cloudinary.com/tools)
- [Compress PNG to 10KB - Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/tools/compress-png-to-10kb)


Example conversion process:
[Cloudinary PNG to WebP](https://cloudinary.com/tools/png-to-webp)
1. Upload your `.jpg` or `.png` file.
2. Convert it to `.webp` format for better compression.
3. Download the `.webp` image.

---

###  Step 2: Resize Image to 20x20 Pixels

After compression, resize the image to around **`20x20 pixels`** (small but visible enough for placeholders).  
Use [Image Resizer](https://imageresizer.com/) for quick resizing.  
This tiny version will act as your **`LQIP preview`**.


---

###  Step 3: Convert Image to Base64

Now, convert your resized image to `Base64` format using:

- [Base64 Image Encoder](https://www.base64-image.de/)

Steps:
1. Upload the **`20x20 px`** image.
2. After processing image click </> button.
3. Copy the **`Base64 string`** shown under `For use in <img> elements`.

Example output:

```
data:image/webp;base64,UklGRiIAAABXRUJQVlA4IBYAAAAwAQCdASoBAAEALwA...
```

---

###  Step 4: Add Base64 LQIP in your page Front Matter

Open your Jekyll post Markdown file (e.g., `_posts/2025-10-18-lqip-guide.md`),  
and paste the Base64 code in the `image:` field inside the front matter.

Example:

```markdown

  lqip: data:image/webp;base64,UklGRkABAABXRUJQVlA4IDQBA...

```

`This will show the Base64 image as the thumbnail in post previews until the full-size image loads.`


---
>
The `data:image/webp;base64,` prefix is crucial. It tells the browser that this is a base64-encoded WebP image. This prefix matches the WebP format we used in the LQIP generation step. If you decide to use a different image format in the future, remember to adjust this prefix accordingly (e.g., `data:image/png;base64,` for PNG or `data:image/jpeg;base64,` for JPEG).

## Implement and Test LQIP

To verify that the LQIP implementation is working correctly, follow these steps:

1. Build and Serve Your Jekyll Site to view your site.

2. Navigate to the post where you added the LQIP.
   - Inspect the image loading process. You should see the low-resolution placeholder image (LQIP) first, followed by the high-resolution image once it loads.
   - If you don't notice the LQIP, try clearing your browser cache or using incognito/private browsing mode.

3. **Use Developer Tools**:
   - Open your browser's developer tools.
   - Go to the `Network` tab and refresh the page.
   - Look for the image requests in the network log. Verify that the base64-encoded placeholder image loads initially, followed by the full-resolution image.
   - Check the `Img` column in the Network tab to see the LQIP being used before the main image loads.
   - When you open the `data:image` entry, you should see a small, blurry version of your image. This is your Low-Quality Image Placeholder. If you see this, congratulations! Your LQIP is working correctly.

>
The Chirpy theme natively supports LQIP implementation. If you're not seeing the LQIP effect, double-check your front matter syntax to ensure it matches the format shown in Task 6. If issues persist, verify that you're using the latest version of the Chirpy theme and that no custom modifications are interfering with the LQIP functionality.

### Tips for Best Results

Use `.webp` images whenever possible.

Keep LQIP images under `1KB` in size.

Use descriptive filenames for SEO.

Test loading time using `PageSpeed Insights`.



---

### Final Result

When done correctly, your Chirpy site will:

Load images smoothly.

Look visually polished even before full images appear.

Improve performance and user satisfaction.
